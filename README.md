Welcome to the Redback Chatbot Development Project!

This repository contains the implementation of an advanced chatbot designed to interact across a range of domains, including mental health, medical information, and natural language processing (NLP). The chatbot leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models, specifically Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, to deliver accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a dynamic chatbot that exceeds the capabilities of traditional transformer models by incorporating large language models (LLMs) and RAG architecture. Our chatbot is designed to retrieve and generate responses from a curated knowledge base, providing users with accurate, real-time information.

## Features

- **RAG Architecture:** Leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses by integrating document retrieval and large language models.
- **Advanced Tokenization:** Utilizes subword tokenization methods like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and WordPiece.
- **Vector Embedding:** Implements state-of-the-art embedding techniques, including Word2Vec, GloVe, and fastText.
- **Attention Mechanism:** Enhances the model's ability to focus on the most relevant parts of the input data, ensuring high-quality responses.
- **LLM Integration:** Utilizes large language models to support dynamic and context-aware conversations.
- **Iterative Improvement:** Continuously evaluates and refines the model to optimize performance.
