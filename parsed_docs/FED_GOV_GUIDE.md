###### What type of exercise?

���������������������������������
as many ways as possible,
doing a range of activities that
incorporate fitness, strength,
flexibility and balance (see pages
8–9 for ideas).


"You can’t turn back

the clock but you

can wind it up."


**“No matter what your age, weight, health problems or abilities,**
**you should try and do some form of physical activity.”**

###### How much activity?

����������������������������������
at least 30 minutes of moderate
intensity physical activity on

#### I can t be more active because…


###### Excuses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . and how to overcome them

����������������������� Make it a priority, make time. Get into a routine. Take every chance you can

to be active, even if it’s only for a few minutes – do exercises while waiting
for the kettle to boil or while watching TV (see pages 19–20).

��������������� Once you get started, you will have more energy and feel less tired.

������������������������� Most health problems can be helped by activity. Talk to your doctor – they
and exercise might make may be able to write an ‘ activity prescrip tion’ for you (see pages 16–17 for

��������������������� If you walk or swim it is unlikely that you will get injured.

������������������� Try to find an activity that is free. Walk more instead of driving.

����������������������������� Persuade a relative, neighbour or friend to be active with you.

Play with the grandchildren in the park. Join an activity or walking group.
Take out a gym membership.

��������������������������� Get up early to beat the heat or walk in an air-conditioned shopping centre.

If it’s cold, wear gloves. If it’s raining, take an umbrella.

������������� You are never too old – there is always something you can do.

������������������������������������ Be active around your home – do exercises at home (see pages 19–21).

������������������������ Walk to and from places (the shop, letterbox or a friend’s house).

���������������������������� You will wear out more quickly if you do nothing.

��������������������������������� You don’t have to play sport to be active – try gardening, dancing,

walking or exercise to music.


�����������������������

“It’s so boring on your own . . . ���������������

but it’s OK if you have a friend

�������������������������

to go with. I walk with my

and exercise might make

daughter and we have a bit of

it worse

a chit-chat and catch up on the

���������������������

local gossip.”

�������������������

�����������������������������

���������������������������

�������������

“For 27 years my GP has been

telling me I should do more ������������������������������������

physical activity – but I never di d

������������������������

anything. Then six weeks ago my

����������������������������

friend took me to an exercise class

and I have been going with her ���������������������������������

every week. I feel so much better,

I wish I had done it earlier”


-----

#### What sort of activity should I be doing? Some ideas to keep you moving

**Four types of activity are needed to keep you healthy.** **Try to include at least one activity from each group.**


###### Moderate fitness activities

These activities help to keep your heart, lungs and blood vessels ���������������� �����������������
healthy. ���������������������� �����������������������

������������������ ��������

You should aim to do 30 minutes of activity from this group on

������������ ����������������

most days. This can be in three lots of 10 minutes or two lots of

���������� ���������

15 minutes. If you are just starting out, as little as 10 minutes helps!

������������������ �����������������������

###### Strength activities

These activities help your muscles and bones stay strong and make ��Weight, strength or resistance training exercises
it easier for you to do daily tasks as you get older. ��Lifting and carrying (eg groceries or small children)

��Climbing stairs (instead of taking the lift or escalator)

Make a time to do specific strength exercises two or three times a

��Moderate yard work (eg digging and shifting soil)

week, and build some of them into your everyday activities.

��Calisthenics (eg push ups and sit ups)

###### Flexibility activities

These activities help you to move more easily. They include gentle ���������� ������
reaching, bending and stretching. If you stay flexible you will ����������������������������� ���������
always be able to put on your own shoes and socks. ��������������������� �����������

�����������������������

Try to do some form of stretching every day – even if it is only while

(see pages 20–21)

you are watching TV (see pages 20–21).

###### Balancing activities

These activities will improve your balance and help to prevent falls. For ideas see pages 19 and 21
Make a specific time each day to do these exercises, or fit them in
whenever you can – for example – while waiting for the kettle to boil
(see page 19).


-----

#### Getting started – making a plan


**Use the table on page 14**


**Set some goals – How about**


If you are starting an activity
program it is important to start
out slowly and increase your
activity over time. Be realistic –
don’t make it too hard for yourself
and remember every 10 minutes
counts!

**Choose your activities – Think**
about the four groups of activity
on pages 8–9. Find activities that
you enjoy and want to do.

_My activities will be:_

**__________________________**

**__________________________**


**Set a date to start –**
There is no time like now!

_My start date will be:_

__________________________

__________________________

__________________________

**Choose a time – that you can**
stick with and remember small
changes to your daily habits can
make a big difference to your
total activity level. Get into a
routine. Make a set time to be
active every day.

_My activity time will be:_


**to make an activity plan,**

“I will walk every day for 10 minutes after meals”

**then record your progress.**

“I will park my car farther away from the shops”

“I will walk with the grandchildren to the park”

“I will walk the dog every day this week”

“I will join a walking or cycling group”

“���������������������������������������”

“I will go dancing every week”

_My main goals will be:_

_______________________________________

_______________________________________

_______________________________________

“Back then we stayed active –

our lives depended on it…”

“Today it still does!”


**__________________________**

__________________________

“I never used to do any physical activity. __________________________

Recently I got a dog and now I walk with __________________________

her every morning and every night.

It is helping my blood pressure and

I am getting into dresses I haven’t fitted

into for years.”

#### Making it easier Overcoming setbacks


###### Use reminders

����������������������������
home (eg on the front door
or on the fridge) can help to
remind you to do some activity.

��������������������������������
the door or in the car.

###### Get into a routine

��������������������������������
time and the place.

��������������������������
physical activity in your diary
or on your calendar.

###### Be social

�������������������������������
neighbour or relative in your
activity routine - this will help
keep you both motivated and
committed.


###### Use a diary

���������������������������������
and how you feel after doing
something. That way you can
refer back to it when you feel
less motivated.

���������������������������������
the one on page 14) and put
it on the fridge. You could
even use stickers or gold stars
to mark off each time you are
active.

###### Choose a role model

�����������������������������
is regularly active and fit. Talk
to them and use them as a role
model to keep yourself going.

###### Vary your activity

�������������������������������
time or the place you normally
do your activity to help keep it
interesting.

�������������������������������
of activity you do. Look at the
list again on page 9 to give
you some other ideas.


**Staying active on a regular basis can be a challenge. Sometimes,**

**things come up that break your normal routine, like going on**

**holiday, an injury or a personal matter. The key is to treat the**

**setback as temporary and to get back on track as soon as you can.**

###### Common setbacks . . . and how to overcome them

Coming back after Take it easy when you begin again, do small
injury or illness? amounts of activity until you feel better,
but, if you feel pain, stop.

�������������������������������������������������������������������
no longer suit you? time more convenient.

No fun being active Invite a friend, neighbour or relative to do some
by yourself? physical activity with you. You can help motivate
each other and have a lot of fun.

Join a club or leisure centre for activities like
social tennis, bushwalking, Tai Chi or gentle
exercise. Being active with a group of people
can be very sociable.

�������������������� Maybe it’s time to try something new or involve
seem boring? someone new in your activity.

������������������ Set some new short term goals – give yourself a
too much effort? reward when you achieve them.

Lost the urge? Try something different. Think about the
benefits of being more active.


“Activity can be much easier in water.

I’ve started aqua aerobics – it’s great

for you.

**_Mobility problems_**


Most health problems can
actually be helped by activity –
but check with your doctor, nurse,
physiotherapist, podiatrist or local
fitness centre about the type and
amount of activity you can do.

Remember to start slowly and
don’t push yourself too hard. Be
kind to yourself – but be active in
as many ways as you can.


###### Suggested activities for different health problems

**_Heart problems and/or diabetes_**
����������������������������������
like walking, swimming or
cycling. Resistance (or strength)
training should only be
commenced under supervision,
two or three times a week.

**_Cancer_**
Your ability to exercise will
depend on the stage of treatment
you are at. Talk to your doctor or
other health professional about
what you can do.

**_Arthritis_**
Hydrotherapy is excellent. If there
is no program near where you
live, try swimming in a warm pool.


“Most of us don’t feel the impact of

ill-health until something dramatic

happens – like a heart attack or

diabetes. If we had known we were

going to live this long we would have

taken more care of ourselves.

We didn’t care a tinker’s curse when

bullet proof.”


Weight bearing activity and strength
training can help to make bones

**_'Cro ok' knees and back_**
Talk to your physiotherapist about
strengthening exercises.

Talk to your podiatrist about exercises

**_Mental health problems (including_**
**_post traumatic stress disorder [PTSD] )_**
���������������������������������������
as walking, cycling, swimming, playing
sport, and strength training exercises
two or three times a week.

**_Lung problems (including asthma)_**
Swimming, walking, cycling and
tennis are less likely to induce
asthma, especially if the asthma is
well controlled. If you have other
lung problems such as obstructive
pulmonary disease, check with your
doctor about exercise that is suitable

There are lots of chair based activities
you can do – ask your physiotherapist
to help work out what is best for you.

#### Balancing activity with healthy eating


**It is important to try to balance the energy being used for physical**
**activity with energy going into your body (as food and drink). This will**
**help you to maintain a healthy weight and will help to keep your body**
**working well.**

**The National Health and Medical Research Council recommends**
**twelve dietary guidelines for maximum vitality, energy and health**
**in older people.***


**Eat plenty of cereals, breads**

###### Five Six

**and pasta**

These foods are good sources
of energy and fibre, as well as
vitamins B and E and minerals
like iron and zinc. Wholegrain
breads have more fibre, vitamins
and minerals.

###### Seven

**Include foods that are high**
**in calcium**

Having plenty of calcium will
slow bone loss as you age and
help to prevent osteoporosis.
The best sources of calcium are
dairy foods like milk, cheese,
yoghurt, custard and ice cream,
canned fish and soy products.
Choose low fat or calcium
enriched skim milk products.


**Eat plenty of vegetables and fruit**

This means at least two serves of
fruit and five serves of vegetables
every day (a serve is equivalent to
a handful). Sa lads and legumes
(beans) count as vegetables.


###### One

**Enjoy a wide variety of**
**nutritious foods**

Eat something from each of the
five food groups every day.
�������������������������������
noodles
��������������������������������
(beans and peas)
�������
������������������������
��meat, fish, poultry, eggs, nuts

###### Two

**Keep active to maintain muscle**
**strength and a healthy body**
**weight**

Increase all activities and decrease
sitting for long periods.


###### Three

**Eat at least three meals**
**every day**

Regular meals make it more likely
that you will get the variety and
amount of food you need. If
you don’t enjoy cooking every
day, buy some cooked meat or
chicken and have it with bread
and salad. Freeze meal sized
portions of left-overs when you
do cook. If you eat out, try not to
over do it with portions.

###### Four

**Care for your food: prepare and**
**store it correctly**

Avoid food poisoning by
selecting, handling, storing and
preparing your food carefully.
Clean your fridge every week,
and throw out anything that has
been there too long!


-----

###### Eight

**Eat a diet which is low in**
**saturated fat**

This will help to control
cholesterol. Saturated fat is
usually solid at room temperature
– like the fat that collects in the
tray when you grill sausages. It is
easy to see on the edge of pieces
of meat, but can be hidden in
processed meats and cheese.
Use canned fish instead of deli
meat on sandwiches. Avoid lard
and copha – they can be hidden
in some biscuits and fast foods.


###### Nine

**Choose food low in salt and use**
**salt sparingly**

This will help to control blood
pressure. Salt is essential for life,
but fresh food contains all the
salt you need. There is no need
to add salt to food. Try using
herbs and spices to add flavour
instead of salt.

###### Ten

**Use added sugars in moderation**

Sugars found in many natural
foods such as milk and fruit are
good for you. But some foods,
such as soft drinks, cordial,
lollies, honey and jam are
almost entirely sugar. Try to eat
these foods only occasionally,
especially if you have glucose
intolerance.

Eating lots of high sugar food
will cause tooth decay.


###### Eleven

**Drink adequate amounts of water**
**and/or other fluids**

If your urine is dark yellow (except
first thing in the morning) you are
not drinking enough.

����������������������������������
���������������������
���������������
�������������������������
kidneys
������������������������������
��������������������������������
infections and kidney stones

Water, soup, tea, coffee, juice,
custard, milk, jelly and ice cream
are all fluids.

If you are
incontinent or
sometimes leak
a little urine,
you still need to
drink sufficient
fluids, because
concentrated
urine increases
the desire to go to the toilet.
Make sure you have a night light if
you have to go to the toilet during
the night, and ask your doctor or


###### Twelve

**If you drink alcohol, limit**
**your intake**

In moderation, alcohol can be
a pleasure and can enhance a
meal. Small amounts (no more
than two standard drinks per
day) can be beneficial, but too
much will damage your health.


As you age, your liver is less able
to deal with alcohol. You will
also be more likely to trip and
fall (and maybe end up with a
fracture) if you drink too much.
Ask your doctor whether it is safe
to drink alcohol if you are taking
medications, and never ever
drink and drive.
