bones in good working order.


�����������������������������������

What type of exercise?

���������������������������������
as many ways as possible,

incorporate fitness, strength,
flexibility and balance (see pages
8–9 for ideas).

#### What sort of activity should I be doing? Some ideas to keep you moving

**Four types of activity are needed to keep you healthy.** **Try to include at least one activity from each group.**


Moderate fitness activities

These activities help to keep your heart, lungs and blood vessels ���������������� �����������������
healthy. ���������������������� �����������������������

������������������ ��������

You should aim to do 30 minutes of activity from this group on

������������ ����������������

most days. This can be in three lots of 10 minutes or two lots of

���������� ���������

15 minutes. If you are just starting out, as little as 10 minutes helps!

������������������ �����������������������

Strength activities

These activities help your muscles and bones stay strong and make ��Weight, strength or resistance training exercises

��Climbing stairs (instead of taking the lift or escalator)

Make a time to do specific strength exercises two or three times a

week, and build some of them into your everyday activities.

��Calisthenics (eg push ups and sit ups)

Flexibility activities

These activities help you to move more easily. They include gentle ���������� ������
reaching, bending and stretching. If you stay flexible you will ����������������������������� ���������
always be able to put on your own shoes and socks. ��������������������� �����������

�����������������������

Try to do some form of stretching every day – even if it is only while

(see pages 20–21)

you are watching TV (see pages 20–21).

Balancing activities

These activities will improve your balance and help to prevent falls. For ideas see pages 19 and 21
Make a specific time each day to do these exercises, or fit them in
whenever you can – for example – while waiting for the kettle to boil
(see page 19).


-----

#### Getting started – making a plan


If you are starting an activity
program it is important to start
out slowly and increase your
activity over time. Be realistic –
don’t make it too hard for yourself
and remember every 10 minutes
counts!

**Choose your activities – Think**
about the four groups of activity
on pages 8–9. Find activities that
you enjoy and want to do.

_My activities will be:_

**__________________________**

**__________________________**


**Set a date to start –**
There is no time like now!

_My start date will be:_

__________________________

__________________________

__________________________

**Choose a time – that you can**
stick with and remember small
changes to your daily habits can
make a big difference to your
total activity level. Get into a
routine. Make a set time to be
active every day.

_My activity time will be:_


**Set some goals – How about**


**Use the table on page 14**


**to make an activity plan,**

“I will walk every day for 10 minutes after meals”

**then record your progress.**

“I will park my car farther away from the shops”

“I will walk with the grandchildren to the park”

“I will walk the dog every day this week”

“I will join a walking or cycling group”

“���������������������������������������”

“I will go dancing every week”

_My main goals will be:_

_______________________________________

_______________________________________

_______________________________________

“Back then we stayed active –

our lives depended on it…”

“Today it still does!”


**__________________________**

__________________________

“I never used to do any physical activity. __________________________

Recently I got a dog and now I walk with __________________________

her every morning and every night.

It is helping my blood pressure and

I am getting into dresses I haven’t fitted

into for years.”

#### Making it easier Overcoming setbacks


Use reminders

����������������������������
home (eg on the front door
or on the fridge) can help to
remind you to do some activity.

��������������������������������

Get into a routine

��������������������������������

or on your calendar.

Be social

activity routine - this will help
keep you both motivated and
committed.


Use a diary

���������������������������������
and how you feel after doing
something. That way you can
refer back to it when you feel
less motivated.

it on the fridge. You could
even use stickers or gold stars
to mark off each time you are
active.

Choose a role model

to them and use them as a role
model to keep yourself going.

Vary your activity

list again on page 9 to give
you some other ideas.


**Staying active on a regular basis can be a challenge. Sometimes,**

**things come up that break your normal routine, like going on**

**holiday, an injury or a personal matter. The key is to treat the**

#### Coping with chronic health problems


Most health problems can
actually be helped by activity –
but check with your doctor, nurse,
physiotherapist, podiatrist or local
fitness centre about the type and
amount of activity you can do.

Remember to start slowly and
don’t push yourself too hard. Be
kind to yourself – but be active in
as many ways as you can.

“Most of us don’t feel the impact of

ill-health until something dramatic

happens – like a heart attack or

diabetes. If we had known we were

going to live this long we would have

taken more care of ourselves.

We didn’t care a tinker’s curse when

bullet proof.”


Suggested activities for different
health problems

**_Heart problems and/or diabetes_**
����������������������������������
like walking, swimming or
cycling. Resistance (or strength)
training should only be
commenced under supervision,
two or three times a week.

**_Cancer_**
Your ability to exercise will
depend on the stage of treatment
you are at. Talk to your doctor or
other health professional about
what you can do.

is no program near where you

**_Lung problems (including asthma)_**

tennis are less likely to induce
asthma, especially if the asthma is
well controlled. If you have other
lung problems such as obstructive
pulmonary disease, check with your
doctor about exercise that is suitable

There are lots of chair based activities

#### Balancing activity with healthy eating

**It is important to try to balance the energy being used for physical**
**activity with energy going into your body (as food and drink). This will**
**help you to maintain a healthy weight and will help to keep your body**
**working well.**

**The National Health and Medical Research Council recommends**
**twelve dietary guidelines for maximum vitality, energy and health**
**in older people.***


**Eat plenty of vegetables and fruit**

Five Six


This means at least two serves of
fruit and five serves of vegetables
every day (a serve is equivalent to
a handful). Sa lads and legumes
(beans) count as vegetables.


**Eat plenty of cereals, breads**
**and pasta**

These foods are good sources
of energy and fibre, as well as
vitamins B and E and minerals
like iron and zinc. Wholegrain
breads have more fibre, vitamins
and minerals.

Seven

**Include foods that are high**
**in calcium**

Having plenty of calcium will
slow bone loss as you age and
help to prevent osteoporosis.
The best sources of calcium are
dairy foods like milk, cheese,
yoghurt, custard and ice cream,
canned fish and soy products.
Choose low fat or calcium
enriched skim milk products.


One

**Enjoy a wide variety of**
**nutritious foods**

Eat something from each of the
five food groups every day.
�������������������������������
noodles
��������������������������������
(beans and peas)
�������
������������������������
��meat, fish, poultry, eggs, nuts

Two

**Keep active to maintain muscle**
**strength and a healthy body**
**weight**

Increase all activities and decrease
sitting for long periods.


Three

**Eat at least three meals**
**every day**

Regular meals make it more likely
that you will get the variety and
amount of food you need. If
you don’t enjoy cooking every
day, buy some cooked meat or
chicken and have it with bread
and salad. Freeze meal sized
portions of left-overs when you
do cook. If you eat out, try not to
over do it with portions.

Four

**Care for your food: prepare and**
**store it correctly**

Avoid food poisoning by
selecting, handling, storing and
preparing your food carefully.
Clean your fridge every week,
and throw out anything that has
been there too long!


-----

Eight

**Eat a diet which is low in**
**saturated fat**

This will help to control
cholesterol. Saturated fat is
usually solid at room temperature
– like the fat that collects in the
tray when you grill sausages. It is
easy to see on the edge of pieces
of meat, but can be hidden in
processed meats and cheese.
Use canned fish instead of deli
meat on sandwiches. Avoid lard
and copha – they can be hidden
in some biscuits and fast foods.

_Low salt food contains less than 120mg sodium –_
_per 100g of food_


Nine

**Choose food low in salt and use**
**salt sparingly**

This will help to control blood
pressure. Salt is essential for life,
but fresh food contains all the
salt you need. There is no need
to add salt to food. Try using
herbs and spices to add flavour
instead of salt.

Ten

**Use added sugars in moderation**

Sugars found in many natural
foods such as milk and fruit are
good for you. But some foods,
such as soft drinks, cordial,
lollies, honey and jam are
almost entirely sugar. Try to eat
these foods only occasionally,
especially if you have glucose
intolerance.

Eating lots of high sugar food
will cause tooth decay.


Eleven

**Drink adequate amounts of water**
**and/or other fluids**

If your urine is dark yellow (except
first thing in the morning) you are
not drinking enough.
