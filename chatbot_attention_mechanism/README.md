AI Chatbot with Attention Mechanism
Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an AI chatbot that leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including tokenization, vectorization, and a self-attention mechanism, to enhance its conversational capabilities. The chatbot is designed for seamless website integration, providing users with accurate and contextually relevant responses across a wide range of topics. The inclusion of the attention mechanism allows the chatbot to focus on relevant parts of the input text, improving its understanding of context and generating better responses.
