AI Chatbot with Attention Mechanism
Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an AI chatbot that leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including tokenization, vectorization, and a self-attention mechanism, to enhance its conversational capabilities. The chatbot is designed for seamless website integration, providing users with accurate and contextually relevant responses across a wide range of topics. The inclusion of the attention mechanism allows the chatbot to focus on relevant parts of the input text, improving its understanding of context and generating better responses.

Key Features
Self-Attention Mechanism: Improves context understanding by focusing on important parts of the input text.
Tokenization and Vectorization: Breaks down text into tokens and transforms them into numerical vectors for machine learning models.
Dataset Integration: Merged multiple datasets into one comprehensive dataset to enhance the chatbot's range and accuracy.
Robust Performance: Optimized code for better execution speed and improved response quality.
Website Integration: Designed to be easily integrated into web platforms for real-time user interaction.
Technologies Used
Python: Core language for developing the chatbot.
TensorFlow: For building and training the machine learning models.
Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing and model evaluation.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For data visualization (if needed).
SQL: For data storage and management of user interactions.

How It Works
Dataset Preparation: All datasets were merged into a single comprehensive dataset covering diverse topics. This ensures that the chatbot has a wide knowledge base.
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization and vectorization are used to convert user input into numerical data the model can understand.
Self-Attention Mechanism: This advanced algorithm helps the chatbot to focus on the most relevant parts of the user input, improving the quality of responses.
Model Training: The chatbot is trained on the prepared dataset using machine learning algorithms to improve its conversational abilities.
Code Optimization: The project includes optimized code for better readability, performance, and ease of future updates.
